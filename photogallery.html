            <p>The following photos are just some of the many I have taken over the years. These were all captured using my Canon Rebel T3i DSLR camera while working for the Glengarry News, a small community newspaper in my hometown, in the summer of 2019. These photos are some that I am most proud of during that time working as a journalist. </p>

Being the media, I was allowed right out on the field in order to get the best shots. Usually I am playing with the band, which can be seen in the background, but that time I gained a new perspective.">

My editor called me on my way home and asked if I could swing by this demonstration of new dog resuscitation kits that a local firesatition had acquired. I was the only person who showed up. Had I not gone, this story would have just been unrrealized.">
