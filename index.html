            <p class="p">My name is Taylor Stanley Ross Young, I am 23 and a student at the University of Ottawa in the Digital Journalism program.</p>
<p class="p">I have made websites before, but they were created from templates which I then modified using HTML and CSS. While I have played around on my own time with making websites from scratch, using notepad, I have never made live any of my work.</p>

<p class="p">My hobbies include reading, writing, listening to music, playing video games with my friends, and playing the bagpipes.</p>

              <p class="p">I grew up in a small town roughly an hour east from Ottawa. Much of the county was built up of farms and farmland, which made it easy to find summer jobs after a long school year. Since I was young, I've spent nearly every summer driving tractors, making hay, and taking care of livestock. It wasn't until I went away to school at Algonquin that I was able to get a job during the summer in anything other than farming. </p>

                  <figcaption class="photo-cap2">This photo was taken in celebration at the end of a busy summer. i had injured my leg quite seriously and was not allowed to do hard labour. Luckily it was just the start of harvest season and the majority of the work was driving machinery around.</figcaption>
              <p class="p">During the summer of 2019 I managed to get a job with my local newspaper, The Glengarry news. There I was given the opportunity to put all my journalistic training to the test. I believe I did quite a good job as I was complimented many times by readers throughout the community. I was even offered a full-time job by the publication, provided I quit school. I politely declined the offer as progressing my education and gaining more credentials aligned more with my career plan. I also realized early on in the employment that, while it is important, small community newspapers are not the type of news I want to be in. I want to be doing something that has a bit of unpredictability and excitement; which can be tough to find when you report on the same events every year.</p>
